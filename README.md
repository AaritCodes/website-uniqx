# UniqX — Production-ready demo (replace placeholders with real content)

This project contains a multi-page Next.js + Tailwind site branded as UniqX. The build includes:

- Animated charts (Recharts) and framer-motion for subtle UI animation.
- ROI calculator component (components/RoiCalculator.jsx) — use real numbers to estimate ROI.
- Floating chat widget (components/ChatWidget.jsx) which saves messages to `messages.json`.
- Portfolio pages with screenshot placeholders — replace with real images.
- SEO, Website and SMM detailed service pages with forms that POST to `/api/quotes`.

IMPORTANT: I did **not** invent client results. Replace all placeholder/projected numbers and screenshots with your real data and case studies before publishing.

Run locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Files to edit for real data: pages/*.jsx, components/*, public/* (add real images).
